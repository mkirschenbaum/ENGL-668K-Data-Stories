MATT: Arielle, this is an excellent overview and discussion of the challenges involved in analyzing what is, as you say, a very complex data set. You make good use of TAGS/Sheets in order to organize the data, and are appropriately measured and conservative in terms of the conclusions you draw from it. As I said to Jacques, I suspect this is an instance where the most promising insights would only become possible after the collection of a much larger data set. This is nicely done with what you had to work with.


For this TAGS project, Jacques and I decided to look that the data rendered from entering #ShoutYourAbortion. This was a hashtag that began trending in September 2015 from two primary users, Amelia Bonow and Lindy West. The hashtag was initially started as a way of sharing experiences of women’s abortions, largely as a way of rationalizing or prioritizing other factors in women’s lives, such as education and fiscal stability. In sum, the hashtag was started as a way of attempting to dismantle much of the vitriolic rhetoric that surrounds not only abortion, but also women’s bodies on the twittersphere. 

What we saw when we entered this hashtag in the TAGS plug in was really interesting. The data set was summarily split; and, like many narratives surrounding abortion, it consisted of two diametrically opposed perspectives not just about abortion itself, but about the emotive response users had to women tweeting about their choice to have an abortion.  Largely, half of the data set were female users who had tweeted stories of their abortion and how they saw it benefitting them and their partner. Others addressed the politics of women’s rights at large. For example, on October 2nd, @pedalpapa (a male) tweeted, “What if we treated everyone who wants a gun like everyone who wants an abortion?” This particular tweet was retweeted by 3,500 users and liked 3,000 times. Other tweets attempted a similar kind of political approach, but were not as widely acknowledged by users, like that of @RealtinConnor on November 29: “My daily reminder to the shitheels trolling #ShoutYourAbortion, trying to shame ppl: Fuck off. #Prochoice is #prolife. “ The #prolife and #prochoice hashtags seemed to contribute to the split in the data set. Many users who utilized the #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag for its original purpose equated the two, ultimately creating a narrative that said abortion was necessary for the life and welfare of the woman rather than the fetus. 

The split in the narrative that we collected from the data signaled a kind of hijacking with regard to the #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag. We even found a twitter account called @ShoutYrAbortion, which has a banner photo of an unborn fetus that contains the text “#abortionsurvivor.” The biography in this particular twitter profile says: “If abortion is about women’s rights, then what were mine? #DefundPP #ShoutYourAdoption #Abortionsurvivor.”  The creation of this account seemingly attempts to deny the original hashtag its intended purpose. While the data didn’t suggest that it completely succeeded in do so—as there were a large number of users who used the hashtag to tell the original narrative—the @ShoutYrAbortion account seemed to present itself as an obstacle for the original narrative and its users. In other words, if the @ShoutYrAbortion account succeeded in only blocking or countering narratives of positive experiences of abortion, then it was doing its job. However, this is only what the data seemed to suggest.  

I also organized the users from the TAGS template into an excel sheet and alphabetized them. This was a way to see which users had tweeted the original hashtag the most, but also helped to categorize the context in which they were referencing the hashtag; in other words, it showed whether users were continuing the original narrative of the hashtag, or whether they were trying to spin it in an argument against #ShoutYourAbortion. Again, I saw a split amongst the users. I had to use this list in reference to twitter, but I think it was useful in being able to visualize what accounts were strongly associated with the original narrative and how users that associated their tweets with the counter-narrative manipulated the original hashtag. 

I think this was actually a complicated data set to examine. Jacques and I both noted that a hashtag has the inherent ability to present a more cohesive and concrete narrative rather than an individual user. It would be interesting to utilize more tools as a way of organizing the tweets according to who used the hashtag for its original purpose versus those tweets that seemingly hijacked it.
