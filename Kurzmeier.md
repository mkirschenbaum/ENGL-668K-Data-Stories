MATT: Michael, interesting attempt to draw some conclusions about some very particular individual habits as ascertained by metadata in the tweets (device, timestamp, etc.) though you also (rightly) acknowledge the limitaitons of this approach. I may be overlooking it, but is there a link available to your TAGS data?

###Module 3 Exercise Data Story

My approach for this module was to do a quantitative analysis of a large number of
tweets from a single account. For this, I worked with the collected data of 798 tweets by
soccer player Christiano Ronaldo. The tweets were send from between 28th November 2013
and 23rd November 2015. To be able to display device usage per time of day, I filtered the
data through "source" and “time”. Then I reformatted the cells to only display time since
Twitter combines time and date in the “time" attribute.
The formatted data was then displayed in a graph showing all 789 tweets sorted by
time send and device used. Time used is local time, so the time zone recorded is determined
by the client side – Ronaldo lives in Madrid.
This visualization reveals some insight into the relation between time of day and
preferred device. Firstly, the strong difference in used devices which can be categorized as

####Mobile
Iphone 16
Ipad 19
Twitter for Android 99
Mobile Web 3

####Desktop
Twitter web client 442
Facebook 2
Twitter for Websites 2

####And commercial
Sportlobster, a sports news website, 52
Mobioinsider, an advertisement platform shut down in May 2015, 144
VivaRonaldo, Ronaldo`s social network platform shut down in September 2015, 17

Also, a correlation between preferred device and time of day can be quite clearly
seen in the graph. As seen in the above detail of the graph, mobile apps outweigh desktop
apps during the late afternoon and night, while desktop apps are dominant during daytime.
Further, another correlation between device and
interactivity can be observed. Surprisingly, longer twitter
conversations are more likely to take place via the Web
client or mobioinsider.com than via the mobile apps. Those
conversations leave characteristic traces of multiple, closely
aligned symbols on the graph. The more these lines are
oriented horizontally, the quicker the interactions happened.
Especially mobioinsider.com has created many of those
signatures on the graph, whereas mobile apps seem to be
more evenly distributed.

But the graph can also tell us interesting things
about the author’s habits as such. As there are hardly any
tweets late at night or early in the morning, it is to assume
that Ronaldo follows a regular sleep pattern with an average
of around 8 hours of sleep per night. Further, Ronaldo rarely
uses his Ipad during the day, the few exceptions usually
being weekends. Even though he uses the Iphone and Android client, most mobile tweets
were send through the Android, leading to the assumption that he keeps the Android device
with him during the day.

The limitations of this approach are clearly the reduction of two years of tweets onto a
24 hour time frame. Especially since two of the commercial websites are no longer online, it is
unclear how this affects the validity of the data. Also the commercial character of those
accounts leaves question of whether Ronaldo himself authored these tweets of if they were
written by a third party. This could additionally falsify any claimed connections between the
data and Ronaldo`s usage preferences. This exercise and the gained data and experience
will also be used in the final essay to discuss problems of archiving and visualizing data
gained from a network.
