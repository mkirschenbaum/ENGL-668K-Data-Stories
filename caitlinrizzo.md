MATT: Really nice write-up, Caitlin; I like your framing throughout as "curation," for that is surely what this process is. You also seem to have made good use of TAGS/Sheets features like the Pivot tables. Well done.


#Feminist for a Day: Reading the Feminism in Popular Culture 

TAGS Spreadsheet URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cpSB5p_bnBL0DEmL2wfRmWbOk1JEP9ejmyX7smD9E7k/edit?usp=sharing

If Ian Bogost argued in his blog “The Turtlenecked Hairshirt” that humanists “must want to be of the world, rather than hidden from it…must be brutal,” then there is surely no more brutal real world climate than the online community for the feminist*  (Bogost 242). For our dataset, Dominique and I scraped Twitter for a series of three days, ultimately to isolate any instances of the use of “#feminist” over the life-cycle of a single day in social media. This dataset allowed us to capture how the term gets appropriated and used by “Tweeters” (and perhaps “bots”) and to see how term is applied and associated in the contemporary moment. 

Of course, there are limitations in the dataset itself. By selecting the term “#feminist” over alternate variations like “#feminism” or phrases like “#womensliberation” or “#womenslib,” we had already made some curatorial decisions that ultimately affect our data: the term “feminist” implies a person who regards themselves already in favor of the cause whereas “feminism” is more generic, and phrases like “women’s liberation” are more politically engaged but take up more characters. Given the limitations of Twitter and an interest first and foremost in the work of the issues of self-identified feminists in the online community, it seemed natural to choose the former. Though certainly, choosing from any of the other three would have yielded different results. 

We also imposed a time limit for the period over which we would collect data. We made this decision in the hopes to create a more usable dataset that would allow us to manipulate the data at large, but also close read the Tweets themselves for content. A day seemed to offer us a relatively representative snapshot in the online lives of a “#feminist[s].”  However, here again we faced questions of curation. As I was in charge of the dataset, I chose to isolate a Monday, given that the weekday seemed more representative of the mundane, in my mind, then the weekend, and we were looking for a fairly typical representation of the average, the ordinary, in the life of the Twitter feminist. 

After eliminating the data we would not use from view, I created two pivot tables to manipulate the data. The first spreadsheet consisted of the entries strings collected from the Twitter API; this allowed me to more easily view what hashtags commonly used alongside “#feminist.” However, because of the limitations of TAGS collecting abilities, this table is a little difficult to read and reproduce. While it does allow me to see the list of hashtags used in concordance alphabetically arranged (which also allows me to see duplicates that appeared and how often they appeared), it doesn’t allow me an accurate count of how many times each hashtag is used in the data set. The second table consists of the users most frequently posting Tweets with “#feminist” and how many tweets they posted over the course of the day. The two tables together allow me to draw out some interesting results. 

Here is the list of the top fifteen Tweeters who used the “#Feminist” over the course of Monday, December 7th: 

WomenWorldNews1	178
RockMetalKittyX	165
Constitution_SD	106
pussyfetishstl	35
HumanistPundit	25
girlslikesperm	22
JRLuxor	21
g56yu	20
OrlandoDenis21	19
fireinthedawn	19
SeleneMichaels	17
MQdesigns13	17
yodovoo	16
NancyCamp15	15
Porn_Junkie_	14

I think its natural for any reader of this data to notice the prevalence of two major kinds of users, including women’s advocacy accounts like “WomenWorldNews1,” as well as feminist activists like “Constitution_SD,” and “HumanistPundit,” but equally represented are groups of users associated with pornography like “pussyfetishstl,” “girlslikesperm,” and “Porn_Junkie.” The hashtags that accompany “#feminist” paint a similar story, amid scores of “#IStandWithPP,” “#endviolenceagainstwomen,” and “#Equality,” there is a concurrent thread of hashtags like: “#cumshot”(37 in all), “#cumswallow,” (even more than 37), and “#nudes.” Not unpredictably many of these latter hashtags are associated with porn accounts like “girlslikesperm.” 

Though, lest we assume that pornography is itself not part of a feminist’s or women’s repertoire (as was an integral fight during second wave feminism), I did do research into these three users. First, to see that they were not “bots” affecting data by actual human entities, and second to confirm my own hypothesis: that #feminist is a term that has been appropriated equally by women as by those seeking to control women most stridently as a way to maintain dominance in spaces (including the online community) that have been traditionally male. 

My hypothesis was not disproved, unfortunately. Two accounts, “girlslikesperm” and “pussyfetishist1,” were run by the same group of men who claim to also be recording artists, but basically curate an entire feed of exploitative and degrading pictures of women’s body parts alongside hyper masculine logos that borrow from comic book and video game typography. The third is a little more mysterious, and a little sadder, picturing women who look dejected in the middle of hostile, exploitative sex acts. I suppose when Bogost calls for us to be “brutal” this is one example of what that means: to face that outside the walls of academia what we’ve created is being thrown back into our faces, and that for self identified #Feminists (and I am one, let me say now), we need to reclaim the terms of our dignity. 

Endnote: * I could cite here far reaching evidence of hostility toward women online in recent cultural memory, as far reaching as Gamer Gate’s take-down of Brianna Wu to the online harassment of classics scholar Mary Beard covered in the New Yorker in 2014. Examples are far ranging and pervasive even in traditionally liberal fields and in youth-culture. A host of studies have now been conducted to confront the hostility of the online environment towards women, including the Pew Research Center’s October 2014 study “Online Harassment,” academic research studies like “Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour” published in July 2015 in PLS One by Michael Kasumovic and Jeff Kuznekoff.
